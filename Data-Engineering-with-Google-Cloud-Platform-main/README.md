This is the code repository for [Data Engineering with Google Cloud Platform]

**A practical guide to operationalizing scalable data analytics systems on GCP**

you'll understand how the highly scalable Google Cloud Platform (GCP) enables data engineers to create end-to-end data pipelines right from storing and processing data and workflow orchestration to presenting data through visualization dashboards.


This git covers the following exciting features: 
* Load data into BigQuery and materialize its output for downstream consumption
* Build data pipeline orchestration using Cloud Composer
* Develop Airflow jobs to orchestrate and automate a data warehouse
* Build a Hadoop data lake, create ephemeral clusters, and run jobs on the Dataproc cluster
* Leverage Pub/Sub for messaging and ingestion for event-driven systems
* Use Dataflow to perform ETL on streaming data
* Unlock the power of your data with Data Studio
* Calculate the GCP cost estimation for your end-to-end data solutions
